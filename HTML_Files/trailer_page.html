            <p class="last" >The murder mystery only begins as more people wound up dead. The deed is always done in the same forest. The locals started calling it the <strong>Forest of Fright</strong> after these tragic events. Every case starts the same with people just having a regular day at the park right by the forest. The murders all connect to one person who is driven by circumstance to kill for a living. No one knows the truth of the real motives and what the real purpose of this hitman organization is. But one thing is for sure; they must be stopped! It looks like we have a murder mystery on our hands.</p><br/>
